## Hi there, name is Aishu! ğŸ‘‹


ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m a marketing professional with a growing passion for analytics. <br/>
ğŸŒ± What drew me into analytics? Realizing how often decisions are based on creative instinct or "this looks right" rather than digging into data. <br/>
ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m excited to explore the nitty-gritty of analytics to make smarter, data-driven marketing strategies. <br/>
ğŸ’¬ Letâ€™s connect to discuss how combining creativity with data can drive better outcomes! <br/>
